    I always enjoyed problem solving, and figuring out the best way to achieve the result that was required. Having had many friend code before me, I always knew it was something that would interest me, and that I would really enjoy, but never had the opportunity to pursue any possible career. This year I finally had the opportunity to give it a try, and the course at GA provided the best platform for me to achieve a basic understanding to help me get going with a new career.

    Over the course I have thoroughly enjoyed being back in a learning environment and bettering my understanding of code, but also of getting results with the tools that I have. Now that I have finished the course I hope to continue this path of learning by finding a place in a company that will allow me to continue to flourish and I can see how high I can fly!
