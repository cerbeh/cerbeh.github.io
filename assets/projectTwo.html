            Project two is an event hosting website built using Node.js & Express to host a Mongoose database and then EJS to render the front end pages. Over the course of one week we were asked to build a fully RESTful app, on a subject of our choice.

            I really enjoyed my first experience of utilising databases and spent a lot of time ensuring that the information stored inside the models was well organised and allowed for the information to be more easily accesable to the front-end.

            At the start, trying to make sure that I wasn't hard coding a lot of the early functions so that they could be called on later on in the build process without having to change too much. It took a while to work out the logic to achieve this and I maybe invested a bit too much time in to it and wasn't able to get to some of the more advanced features that I had originally planned that would help players advance further in to the game once the speeds get a lot faster.

            If I had the chance to make this game again I would start making the basic game at first and then implement bonus features later once MVP had been reached. Initially I started with bonus tiles in mind and lost time trying to future proof my code with features I ended up not using.
