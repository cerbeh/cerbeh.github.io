          Project one started with the brief to make a browser based game using HTML, CSS and Javascript (with the help of Jquery). Over the course of a week (Friday afternoon - Thursday evening), we had to build and style a game of our own creation. The idea behind the game was to have the tiles falling through the game grid and the user would interact with them depending on which colour it was.

            I really enjoyed the challenge of creating something from scratch. Creating the game logic first, then putting features on top of it, and the experience of how the game idea evolved through the coding process with what was possible.

            At the start, trying to make sure that I wasn't hard coding a lot of the early functions so that they could be called on later on in the build process without having to change too much. It took a while to work out the logic to achieve this and I maybe invested a bit too much time in to it and wasn't able to get to some of the more advanced features that I had originally planned that would help players advance further in to the game once the speeds get a lot faster.
            In addition, at the start

            If I had the chance to make this game again I would start making the basic game at first and then implement bonus features later once MVP had been reached. Initially I started with bonus tiles in mind and lost time trying to future proof my code with features I ended up not using.
